- i need to reliably build attrs from paths
- i have to find out if the basic structure is matched
- i have to find out if there is a valid 'scope'
- i have to find out if there is a valid 'context'

test - app config reliably returns something with the following:
- ['paths']
- ['paths']['rules']
- each part within 'paths' returns an actual location on disk.
